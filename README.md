# Metaheuristic Optimization Using Population-Based Simulated Annealing

There are three (almost identical) versions, one in Python and two in C++:

- [Readme](./Code_Python/README.md) for the Python version.

- [Readme](./Code_Cpp/README.md) for the C++ versions (one using the Eigen library for linear algebra and the other using plain vanilla C++).
